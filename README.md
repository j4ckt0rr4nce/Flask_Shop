# Flask_Shopping_Application

## What's included?

- E-commerce website with its own authentication system

## Installation

This is developed for Python 3 and Flask 2.0.1

It's recommended that you setup a virtualenv before development.

Then just install requirements and runserver to get started:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```

## Customization

I recommend forking this project and just manually modifying it by hand to replace everything with what you want.
Searching for the text on a page in the repository is a great way to find where something lives.
